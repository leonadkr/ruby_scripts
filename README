Some scripts for Ruby.

subtitle_retiming.rb
subtitle_retiming2.rb
Old and rarely used scripts for retiming text-based subtitles (ASS, SRT, IDX/SUB) by lines.
subtitle_retiming2.rb is just a refactoring of subtitle_retiming.rb to make addition of subtitle formats easy.
Four arguments for input:
 first argument is a subtitle file,
 second argument is the first line in the file to retime,
 third argument is the last line in the file to retime,
 fourth argument is a time delay in seconds.
The input file is overwriting by the retimed subtitle.
